'I think I can' was on my mind for a couple of years but I did not dare to take the leap to immerse myself in coding. 'It's too hard', 'I will get stuck and give up', 'I don't have the mind for it', 'It's too time-consuming', 'I can't leave my career', 'I don't even know what it is'. Every time I tried yet another free tutorial the same thoughts would surface up. 

I was too invested in my career in marketing/advertising, and too afraid to take a wrong step off the path that I thought I was on. The one that was drilled down to me from business school, family, friends, co-workers. So I stayed. I continued on a path that was so obvious to everyone but me. I quieted my desire to learn and be challenged by taking business-oriented courses, joining professional networks, and partaking in fitness events/programs. 

A moment of clarity came when I finally allowed myself to let go of the idea of a 'set path'. No, I did not just wake up one day with this thought. It was a combination of everything. I was passively searching for the next step in my life and stumbled upon [We Roam](http://https://www.we-roam.com/), a professional travel-while-working program. This discovery came at the most optimal time and I decided that I would make it work no matter what. So this began the transition from 'I think I can' mindset to 'I will', because I realized that all those 'paths' I've been 'walking' on, are imaginary. And most certainly, not mine. 

Why I chose to learn software development is easy - it provides the challenges I crave, it tests my will power, patience and desire, meanwhile it gives me a chance to see instant results and gives me gratification with each problem solved. I am excited to transition out of my current career into something that I believe to be more meaningful and fulfilling. And I am grateful for finding my way here, changing my mindset and traveling the world while learning how to code with the help of [the Flatiron School](http://https://flatironschool.com/).
