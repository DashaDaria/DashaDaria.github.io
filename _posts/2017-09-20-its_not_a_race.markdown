When I started this program, I had a specific duration in mind. I looked through the entire curriculum and broke it down to fit within a 5 month window, with a goal of finishing within 6 months. I am wrapping up with month 2 now and I am noticing a trend. As soon as I get close to the end of the section, I feel that I've entered a race and need to finish it as fast as I can to get to the next thing, so I can keep within my goal. Usually, the end is the hard part, with unexpected errors, failures and knowledge gaps that were otherwise unnoticed. 

I am aware that learning code is a fluid process and some concepts will take longer than others. That I need to stop looking at the clock, and focus on the material in front of me. I am eager to get to my first project as I think I will be stuck on it for a while. Mostly, I need to change my mindset about how I am learning and accept that this is not a race, that there is only so much new information I can retain within x number of hours.

For my next month, I'd like to bring more awareness to the material at hand, and avoid looking ahead, calculating how many lessons I need to rush through to hit my goal. I'd like to reapproach how I am learning and find time for multiple sources of information. Between the curriculum, slack channels, fb page, study groups, student blogs and live lectures - I feel that there is little time to do my own research on the industry, news, etc. But I think it is important to find that time. So I'd like to add one more trusted source to that list that I can start my day with. 

Off to more knowledge!
