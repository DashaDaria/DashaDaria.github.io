I decided to improve my original idea for the Sinatra project and update it in Rails. Workout Buddy is a Rails app that helps users create and track their workouts. Once a user sign ups, he/she can create their own workouts by adding existing exercises or creating their own. The app keeps track of how many workouts have been completed, as well as determines the intensity level and duration of each workout based on the exercises that comprise it.

Some of the key takeaways for me from this project were in regards to plannig ahead. I usually do not try to go straight into writing code but rather take time to think through the model/migration structure and take time to draw out my relationships. Although I spent a considerable amount of time on this task, I think I would have benefited from looking at various options before deciding on my approach. This would have better prepared me for the scoping requirement and set me up to think more like a user vs. how certain features would need to be developed. 

Another takeaway had to do with timing. When I first approach a big project, I get overwhelmed by how much needs to be done. I always feel that I need to cram everything into one-two days. I decided to take a different approach with this project and allowed myself to split the app tasks into day-by-day goals. Once a goal was done for the day, I focused on my other responsibilities. Although this extended my project timeline, I felt less stressed, rushed and overwhelmed. I felt that I could focus on one aspect at a time and really pay attention to it. After setting my migrations/models I first focused on getting the login/signup process working, with validations, error messages and authentication. Then I moved to figuring out the best user flow with nested and non-nested routes. Next, I created some seed data and focused on getting my controllers and views in order based on user needs. I spent more time on nested forms and scoping as I felt it required me to make more decisions and really look into the general flow of the app. I finished with reviewing all my code files and performing some refactoring.
